# Summation of Integers 
---
This 'C' programme prompts a user to enter an integer between 1 and 10 and calculates the summation of that integer as well as it's factorial.

The actual code and executable programme is not as important. The main reason this programme exists is to practise local Git flow and GitHub CLI from the command line.
